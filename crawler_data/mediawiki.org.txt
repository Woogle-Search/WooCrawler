This log shows four types of actions: deletions of pages, restorations of pages, deletions of page revisions and deletions of log events. The deletion log, as well as a few other logs, allows you to view only specific actions (for example, only restorations of pages). You can set it using the filtering options (that appear above the log itself). A log is an automatically generated list of actions of a certain type,showing when they were performed, by what user, and with respect to what page or other user. Logged actions include page deletions and restorations, page moves (renames), user blocks and unblocks, page protections and unprotections, user account creations, abuse filter reports, and others. Logs can list actions done by a user (or IP editor), actions done to a user (or IP editor), and actions done to a wiki page. Viewing logs To view logs, go to Special:Log on your wiki.\nFrom there you can decide which actions you wish to see logged, and filter by certain other parameters, such as date and time, user and affected page.\nYou can also provide a parameter straight away, as in Special:Log/block , which displays the block log.\nOther parameters that can be used similarly include \"delete\", \"rights\", \"protect\", \"upload\", \"patrol\", etc. A link to the log of actions relating to a particular page can be found on the \"View logs for this page\" link on the history page immediately under the title. A link to the log of actions by a particular user can be found on the left-hand side when the user's talk page or userpage is opened (click the \"Logs\" link at the toolbox).\nRemember, however, that these are actions performed by that user; for actions affecting a given user (such as blocks), the username (preceded by \"User:\") must be entered in the \"Target\" field of the log page, not the \"Performer\" field.\n(This configuration can be accessed directly from the \"View logs for this page\" link at the history page of the user's userpage.) Linking to logs Link Format Example Details Type Special:Log/ type Special:Log/tag One parameter (if it's a valid log type). Performer Special:Log/ user Special:Log/Example One parameter (if it isn't a valid log type). Type and performer Special:Log/ type / user Special:Log/tag/Example user Two parameters, regardless of type validity. See also API:Logevents - API for entries from Special:Log.
